# Edit-Distance-for-Text-Similarity
Edit distance measures the minimum operations to transform one string into another using substitution, deletion, or insertion. It is widely used in NLP, computational biology, and various fields. This tutorial explores Levenshtein distance as a common edit distance metric and its programming implementation in machine learning (ML) applications.
